/*
    Write a program that can find the character that has the highest
    frequency in a String
Note: Must use a map
        Ex:
        str = "eeeeeaaabbbbccccdd"
        Output:
        {e=5, a=3, b=4, c=4, d=2 }
        character e has the highest frequency


        Write a program that can find the element that has the highest
        frequency in an arrayList
        Note: Must use a map

         Ex:
            list: [java, java, python, c#]
        output:
            [java=2, python=1, c#=1]
