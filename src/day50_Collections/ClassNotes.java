package name: day50_Collections

    Collections Framework: consists of multiple interface, each interface is implemented by classes

            Collection (I): dynamic sized
    ready methods
					for non-primitives ONLY

    extended by List, Set, Queue

    List (I): duplicates are allowed, has index number

    ArrayList (C): searching/accessing elements is faster.

    LinkedList (C): insertion /deletion of the element is faster

    Vector (C): is Synhcronized ==> thread-safe

    Stack (C): is Synhcronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO

    pop() ===> LIFO


    Set (I): duplicates are not allowed, does not have index number

    HashSet (C): Maintains random order. Fastest

    LinkedHashSet (C): Maintains insertion order

    TreeSet (C): Maintains sorted order, does not accept null


    Queue (I): duplicates are allowed, does not have index number. FIFO

    poll() ===> FIFO

    PriorityQueue (C): Maintains random order


    ArrayDequeue (C): Maintains insertion order


    LinkedList (C): Maintains insertion order
